### SOLID Principles
- [x] Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - 2025-12-18
  - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
  - Both should depend on abstractions
  - Dependency Injection as implementation technique
  - Examples: Database, Notification, Payment, Logging systems

  - A class should have only one reason to change
  - Identifying responsibilities
  - Separation of concerns
  - Refactoring violations
  - Examples: User management, File operations, Reporting

- [ ] Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Extension through inheritance and composition
  - Strategy pattern and OCP
  - Plugin architectures
  - Examples: Payment processors, Validators, Formatters

- [ ] Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
  - Behavioral subtyping
  - Preconditions and postconditions
  - Invariants
  - Examples: Collections, Shapes, Payment methods

- [ ] Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
  - Fat interfaces problem
  - Creating focused interfaces
  - Role interfaces
  - Examples: Worker interfaces, Device interfaces, Service interfaces
